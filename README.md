# Proposal Title:
Creating an AI-Powered Upskilling Platform for Low-Skilled Workers from Developing Nations in Developed Countries: Enhancing Employment Opportunities

## Abstract:
Migrant workers constitute approximately 3.5% of the global population (around 272 million individuals according to the International Labour Organization) and often face significant barriers to wage growth and career progression. Despite their vital contributions to the economies of developed nations, many migrant workers experience wage stagnation and remain in low-paying jobs with limited potential for advancement. On average, migrant workers earn about 13% less than native-born workers in high-income countries, primarily working in low-skilled sectors such as construction, agriculture, domestic work, and manufacturing. These sectors offer few opportunities for wage increases or career growth. Research indicates that many migrant workers who start in low-wage positions often remain in similar roles for extended periods, with minimal wage growth over a decade or more. Challenges such as language barriers, lack of recognition for qualifications, and discrimination further exacerbate their wage stagnation. To address these issues, this research proposal aims to develop an AI-powered upskilling platform to help low-skilled laborers from developing countries working in developed nations improve their skills and qualifications, making them eligible for better job opportunities. This project aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting quality education, decent work, and reduced inequalities.

## Problem Statement:
The International Labour Organization (ILO) report highlights the significant issues of wage stagnation and pay disparities among migrant workers. Despite spending years abroad, many migrant workers return to their home countries with wages similar to those they initially earned when they left. This stagnation is often due to the lack of transferability of skills and the recognition of foreign work experience in their home labor markets. In Southeast Asia, returning migrant workers face reintegration challenges and often end up in jobs that pay no more than what they earned before migrating. This situation underscores the broader issue of migrant workers being trapped in low-paying jobs with limited upward mobility and significant barriers to wage growth and skill recognition both abroad and upon their return. Addressing these challenges requires targeted policies and programs to support skill development, recognition of qualifications, and fair labor practices for migrant workers.

## Plight of Women Migrant Workers
Nearly half of the world's migrant workers are women, many of whom work in domestic roles and form a significant part of the global domestic workforce. In high-income countries (HICs), migrant women face a dual wage penalty, experiencing disparities due to both gender and migration status. This double burden is particularly evident in the care economy, which includes sectors such as education, health, social work, and personal care services. Wage disparity is influenced by factors such as differences between countries of origin and destination, inconsistent migration laws, and the undervaluation of care work.

This research proposes an AI-driven solution to provide these laborers with accessible, personalized, and effective upskilling opportunities. By leveraging AI, the project aims to close the skills gap, promote economic inclusion, and facilitate career advancement.

## Research Goals:
- Develop an AI-powered upskilling platform that offers personalized learning paths and resources.
- Create AI-driven language and communication training modules to enhance language proficiency.
- Implement AI-based career counseling and job matching services.
- Design the platform to be culturally sensitive and inclusive, addressing the diverse needs of low-skilled laborers.
- Evaluate the platform's effectiveness in improving employment outcomes and facilitating career advancement.

## Description of the Proposed Work:
This project aims to develop an AI-powered upskilling platform tailored for low-skilled laborers from developing countries working in developed nations. The platform will feature personalized learning paths, using advanced machine learning algorithms to customize educational content based on individual users' needs and skill levels. Key features will include language proficiency training, vocational courses, and certification programs recognized in the host countries' labor markets. Additionally, the platform will offer AI-driven career counseling and job matching services to help users find better employment opportunities.

## Expected Outcomes:
The anticipated outcomes of this project include enhancing migrant workers' skills and qualifications, leading to better job prospects and increased wages. By addressing challenges such as language proficiency, recognition of qualifications, and access to relevant training, the platform aims to significantly reduce the wage gap between migrant workers and native-born workers in developed countries. Furthermore, the project will foster economic inclusion and create opportunities for upward mobility within the labor market.

## Results:
The findings of this research will demonstrate the effectiveness of AI in closing skills gaps and promoting career advancement for migrant workers. Successfully implementing this platform will support the economic empowerment of migrant workers, enabling them to achieve fair wages and improved job opportunities. Ultimately, this project will facilitate the integration of migrant workers into the labor markets of host countries and align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of quality education, decent work, and reduced inequalities.

## Related Work:
This research on developing an AI-powered upskilling platform for low-skilled laborers builds on a substantial body of work in the fields of AI, educational technology, and migrant worker integration. Notable works in this domain include the World Bank's STEP (Skills Toward Employability and Productivity) program [8], which uses technology to provide skills development and job matching for workers in developing countries. Similarly, the Coursera Workforce Recovery Initiative [9], launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, offers free access to online courses to help unemployed workers gain new skills and improve their employment prospects. Additionally, platforms like LinkedIn Learning [10] and Khan Academy [11] have shown how AI-driven recommendations can enhance user engagement and learning efficiency by suggesting relevant courses and materials based on user behavior and preferences. However, these tools have been mostly limited to white-collar workers with technical know-how. Our solution aims to cater to blue-collar workers with limited technical knowledge, providing an easy-to-use interface to help upskill them.

## Data Policy:
We are committed to sharing the project's output with the broader community to maximize its impact and foster collaboration. To this end, we will open-source both the data collected during the project and the solution framework developed.
